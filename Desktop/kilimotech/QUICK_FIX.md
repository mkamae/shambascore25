# Quick Fix: API Routes in Local Development

## Problem
You're seeing: "API route not found. In local development, use `npm run dev:api` or `vercel dev`..."

## âœ… Solution

### Step 1: Stop Current Server
Press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal where `npm run dev` is running.

### Step 2: Use API-Enabled Dev Server
Run this command instead:
```bash
npm run dev:api
```

Or directly:
```bash
vercel dev
```

### Step 3: Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env.local` file includes the backend API key:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://jvqyfxlozoehozunfzkv.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key

# Backend API key (no VITE_ prefix - server-side only)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

## What Changed?

- **Old way:** `npm run dev` â†’ Frontend only, no API routes
- **New way:** `npm run dev:api` â†’ Frontend + API routes âœ…

## Alternative

If you don't want to use Vercel CLI locally:
- Test on your deployed Vercel site (everything works automatically there)
- The Farm Health and Plant Diagnosis features will work perfectly in production

## After Running `vercel dev`

The server will:
1. Start on port 3000 (or next available)
2. Handle both frontend and API routes
3. Allow you to test Farm Health and Plant Diagnosis locally

You'll see output like:
```
> Ready! Available at http://localhost:3000
```

Then all your features will work! ðŸŽ‰
