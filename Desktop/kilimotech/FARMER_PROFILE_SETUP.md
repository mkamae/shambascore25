## üìä Database Setup

### Run SQL Schema

Execute `supabase-farmer-profiles-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Creates farmer_profiles table with:
-- - JSONB columns for flexible data storage
-- - Risk score and category fields
-- - Automatic timestamp updates
-- - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
```

### Table Structure

```sql
farmer_profiles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ id (UUID)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ farmer_id (UUID, references farmers)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production_profile (JSONB)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ financial_background (JSONB)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ behavioral_background (JSONB)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ risk_score (NUMERIC 0-1)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ risk_category (Low/Medium/High)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ phone_number (TEXT, for SMS)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ updated_at (TIMESTAMPTZ)

## üîß Risk Calculation Model

### Formula

```typescript
Risk Score = 1 - (
  Production Score √ó 0.3 +
  Financial Score √ó 0.4 +
  Behavioral Score √ó 0.3
)
```

**Lower risk score = Better credit terms**

### Production Score Factors (30% weight)
- Yield stability (variation in historical yields)
- Crop diversification
- Input cost efficiency

### Financial Score Factors (40% weight)
- Repayment record (Poor/Fair/Good/Excellent)
- Past loan history (repayment rate, on-time rate)
- Savings behavior
- Financial infrastructure (bank account, M-Pesa usage)

### Behavioral Score Factors (30% weight)
- Data update frequency
- Timeliness score
- Training participation
- Advisory engagement level

### Risk Categories

| Score Range | Category | Interest Rate | Loan Range |
|-------------|----------|---------------|------------|
| 0.0 - 0.3   | Low      | 8-12%         | KES 100k-500k |
| 0.3 - 0.7   | Medium   | 12-18%        | KES 50k-200k |
| 0.7 - 1.0   | High     | 18-24%        | KES 20k-100k |

## üîå Integration Points

### 1. **Credit Simulator**
The risk score can be integrated with `CreditSimulator` component to show personalized loan terms.

**Future Integration:**
```typescript
// In CreditSimulator.tsx
import { fetchFarmerProfile } from '../services/farmerProfileService';

const profile = await fetchFarmerProfile(farmer.id);
const interestRate = profile.riskCategory === 'Low' ? 10 : 
                     profile.riskCategory === 'Medium' ? 15 : 20;
```

### 2. **SMS Notifications (Placeholder)**

The profile stores `phone_number` for future SMS integration:

**Twilio Integration (Future):**
```typescript
// services/smsService.ts (to be created)
import { Twilio } from 'twilio';

export async function sendRiskAlert(farmerId: string, message: string) {
  const profile = await fetchFarmerProfile(farmerId);
  // Send SMS via Twilio or Africa's Talking
}
```

**Africa's Talking Integration (Future):**
```typescript
// Alternative SMS provider for East Africa
import { AfricasTalking } from '@africastalking/africastalking';

export async function sendFarmingTip(farmerId: string) {
  // Send localized SMS in Swahili/English
}
```

### 3. **AI Insights Integration**

Risk profile data can enhance AI insights:

```typescript
// In geminiService.ts (future enhancement)
const riskInsights = await getRiskInsights(farmer.id);
// Include risk category in AI prompt for tailored advice
```
